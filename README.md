# Boot
1) navigate to the project folder
2) 'npm run start'


# Comments
I am new to css-styling, which leaves much to be desired on the front-end aspect of this project.

I had to learn about API fetching in order to complete the task. This went surprisingly well.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
